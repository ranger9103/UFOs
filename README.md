# UFOs

## Overview
UFO Finder is a dynamic website designed to give the UFO aficionado a place to search for sightings throughout the world. It can be filtered to a location, date, or type of sighting to find exactly what you are looking for. 

## Results 
With this site you can search quickly by date, city, state, country, and/or shape of the sighting. By entering one or multiple of these parameters the site quickly returns the sightings that match what you are searching for.



## Summary 
One drawback of this website is the exact match needed for the filter criteria. This can easily be a cause of frustration for any user.
For future iterations this should be addressed to ensure that users are able to search easily through the data. Another addition for further development would be to add a map feature with the locations of sightings plotted for a quick visual of sighting locations. Another visual showing the dates with the most sightings would also be useful.
Another feature could be user input: a location for sightings to be inputted and then “verified” to be added into the database.
